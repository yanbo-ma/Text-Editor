# Text-Editor

This is a simple text editor application built using Python's `tkinter` library. The application allows users to open, edit, and save text files.

## Features

- Open a text file (`.txt`) for editing.
- Save edited text as a new file or overwrite an existing file.
- User-friendly interface with a resizable window for ease of use.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have Python installed on your system. You can download it from the official [Python website](https://www.python.org/).

### Install Required Libraries

You only need the built-in `tkinter` library for the GUI. `tkinter` typically comes pre-installed with Python. However, if it's missing, you can install it using the following command:

```
pip install tk
```

## Usage

1. Run the `text_editor.py` file using Python.

  ```
  python text_editor.py
  ```
2. The application window will open. You can:

  - Click Open to select a text file to edit.
  - Make changes to the file in the text editor area.
  - Click Save to save the changes to a new or existing file.
